 short-about: I'm not at the point yet where I can write a bio about myself, long or short. I'm not figuring things out anymore, thanks to God for breaking into my heart with a sledge hammer. My focuses in life are dead simple now, and I love it. God, family, others. I'm eager to begin sharing more of my story and how God has turned absolute chaos and destruction into a testimony filled with love, grace, mercy, forgiveness, and salvation. <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.11.28-30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.">Matthew 11:28-30</a>.
 post-bio: Aaron has finally stopped living life according to his own terms. <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.11.28-30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.">Matthew 11:28-30</a>. God took him back, cleaned out his heart, turned all of the lights on, and is shaping his life daily.
