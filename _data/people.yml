 short-about: I'm an entrepreneur at heart and in practice. I have been building businesses from the ground up since I was 17 or so. I am obsessed with making things. I love having an idea for something and then being able to follow through to see that thing become a reality, whether it is a product, service, website, book, etc. Maybe I am more of a creator than anything else, but always making in order to create income. I'm definitely not an artist in that regard, where an artist may make something for the sake of the art, I make for the sake of the sale, or at least for the <em>attempt</em>. Anyways. 
 post-bio: Aaron used to describe himself as a writer and thinker, way back when he first started writing online in the early 2000's. Not much has changed since then. He still writes and he still thinks, and a lot of his thinking actually takes place through his writing. He's also a dad and currently resides in Harrisburg PA.
