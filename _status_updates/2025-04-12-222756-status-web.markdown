More ideas for this page. Need to finish the primary [Status Page project](https://github.com/users/aaronaiken/projects/2/views/1){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}, but first I may implement the way [movie and book reviews](https://github.com/users/aaronaiken/projects/3/views/1){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} are handled as status updates.
