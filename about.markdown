Here's a picture of me.

I'm an entrepreneur at heart and in practice. I have been building businesses from the ground up since I was 17 or so. I am obsessed with making things. I love having an idea for something and then being able to follow through to see that thing become a reality, whether it is a product, service, website, book, etc. Maybe I am more of a creator than anything else, but always making in order to derive income. I'm definitely not an artist in that regard, where an artist may make something for the sake of the art, I make for the sake of the sale, or at least for the _attempt_. Anyways.
