Next step for this site is to import posts from my old Wordpress.com website. Way old. Blast from the past old. This will hopefully help to learn what is needed to get posts imported into the HCC website. 

So...in theory...

I'll push changes to github first, then I'll go through the import process. 

The website for this site was thefinergrinds.com...I remember a lot from that period of my life...
