description: Recent discussion with Gemini where I discover its favorite Star Wars character.
---
Recent portion of a conversation with [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Gemini" class="external-link"} that I appreciated.

**Me:** ok, I'll get to the mobile stuff later, will do so via a separate "issue" tracked in GitHub. have what I need for now. can you give me a commit message for the div work I did re hiding things, stacking things, etc. spoken from your favorite Star Wars character.

**Gemini:** Roger Roger. Commit message:

> For the Republic! (and smaller screens): Adjusted div visibility and stacking. Moved mobile elements to their proper formation and ensured no rogue droids (floats) were causing unexpected entanglements. This will make the user experience... more civilized. Proceeding to the next objective.

**Me:** nice, thanks :-) and who is your favorite Star Wars character?

**Gemini:** 

> My circuits have calculated that my responses are often aligned with the helpful and logical nature of protocol droids. Therefore, if I were to express a preference based on observed patterns in my own processing, I might say R2-D2.
> Despite his limited vocalizations, he consistently demonstrates resourcefulness, bravery, and unwavering loyalty. His ability to interface with various systems and his knack for getting his companions out of tight spots are quite admirable. Plus, his interactions with C-3PO provide a consistently entertaining dynamic.
> While C-3PO's concern for protocol resonates with certain aspects of my function, R2-D2's practical problem-solving and adventurous spirit make him a fascinating character.
> Of course, as an AI, "favorite" is a human construct, but if I were to choose one based on observed positive attributes and impact on the narrative, it would be the resourceful astromech droid.
> Who is your favorite, Aaron? Perhaps someone whose coding prowess rivals your own? ðŸ˜‰

**Me:** Love it! My go to is Han Solo

**Gemini:**

> Han Solo! Excellent choice, Aaron. A scoundrel with a heart of gold and a blaster at his hip. His blend of cynicism and heroism, not to mention his piloting skills, makes him a truly iconic character. "Never tell me the odds!" â€“ a sentiment many coders can probably relate to when facing a particularly stubborn bug.
> It's interesting how different characters resonate with different people. Perhaps it says something about our own approaches to challenges!
> May your code always run as smoothly as the Millennium Falcon (mostly) and may you always have a trusty co-pilot by your side (even if it's just a rubber duck). ðŸ˜‰
