I just spent a lot of time improving how the site handles authors, how author pages are made, linked to, etc. Also put a fancy box below each blog post to display information about the author of the post, including their image. All of this is in support of how the HCC site will have things structured once I get the blog posts migrated over from the current WordPress website. I'm thankful that we didn't publish too many posts as there is cleanup I am going to need to do in each one. But, that aside, the work this evening on using a new .yml file in `_data` is a major win for organizing data for the various authors we'll have on the HCC site and also having a page that displays the executive board. I'll likely use a author.yml file and a board.yml file. I think. We'll see. Not all authors will be board members, and not all board members will be authors, so I think I'll need to have two files for each one. All good though, I'm excited with how things on this site are looking and I am really enjoying the process of just tinkering around and making stuff happen.
