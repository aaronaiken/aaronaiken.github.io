As I go about learning how to use Jekyll, liquid, and Github, I am reminded over and over again why _simplicity_ is the best way to go for a lot of things, if not all things. A simple website, for example, that is focused simply on conveying a message will do well at doing so. If, on the other hand, that same website worries more about features on the site and not the message of the site, then the message will suffer.
