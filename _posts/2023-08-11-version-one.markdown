I think I'm ready to say this site is finished, as far as Version 1 is concerned. The last two items I added were [two Jekyll plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/10-deployment/#plugins). One for having a sitemap generated and the other for having SEO tags generated in the header. I also increased the font size to `x-large` so that it was a bit friendlier on the eyes, and made the footer area push to the left and right edges of the main column. Good enough for me. I'm going to leave pagination alone for now, maybe I'll revisit it when I have more posts to manage, but maybe I won't. Not needed now either way. So at this point I'll begin to take what I learned through this website and apply it to the upcoming new website for the Harrisburg Cigar Club. Will be a good direction for that site in general, and for the club as a whole. Overall we are taking a much simpler approach to how things are structured moving forward, I'm happy to move the website in a similar direction. 

Until next time.
