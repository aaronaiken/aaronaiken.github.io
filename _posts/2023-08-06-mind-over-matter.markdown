Mozzie, my 9 going on 19 year old, has a cough. He's actually had it for a few days now and so we went to the Vitamin Shoppe today to pickup some cough syrup for him to take. No surprise that he hates it, that he has to amp himself up to take it. Each of the four times I helped him take it today turned into motivational speeches. I always end up saying stuff to him during these times that apply directly to areas of my own life: mind over matter, you just have to do it, waiting does not change anything, we are in control of our minds they do not control us, etc. Messages like that to get him to take 1 tablespoon of syrup to help manage his cough. Messages like that to help change the very direction of my life.
