I imported all of my blog posts from my old personal website. And this wasn't even my _first_ personal website. That site would have a birthday of the early 2000's. My first blog was created in 2005. And I've been tinkering on things since then, since very early 2000's. Anyways. So I imported all of the blog posts from this particular WordPress.com site I have, with post dates ranging from 2011 to 2016, and then I deleted all of them. They are all from a very specific period of my life that I quite honestly prefer to leave in the past. There's no need for me to migrate posts to and fro for the sake of carrying that _baggage_ around with me just because I can. They can stay on that old site for as long as the server holding them is powered on. Otherwise, they could be trashed for good and I wouldn't miss any of them. There are some nuggets in there worth something, worth a few seconds of reading, but doing so just takes me back to _when_ it was written and I don't want to go there. Not yet. And so I did it. I performed the import, I know how to do it, and then I undid it. Moving on. Moving forward.
