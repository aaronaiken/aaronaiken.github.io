Making pizza and thinking about a few things. Writing being one of them and really looking forward to when it feel *right* to *write* about my story. Also hoping this pizza turns out. Making the dough is always a mystery process for me. 

I love making dinner for my family, best Friday evening activity!

<br />
Not too long ago, on a Friday evening, I would have forced myself to stop working around 7, rummaged through the pantry or refrigerator for food, made it, sat in front of the TV and watched a show, then went back to work. I’d work until 1am. Then crash. 

That was not living. 

What I have now is living. I worked today, responsibly. I also did a lot for my family. I did a lot for them around the house, I spent a lot of time with them, I hugged them, I kissed them, I served them. 

Now they are all in bed, all kissed goodnight and sleeping soundly. I’ll head to bed after publishing this. A full day behind me, a wonderful day of living for and with my family. Something I will never take for granted again, all thanks to God for changing my heart the way only He could. 

I am so looking forward to telling my story!

Until next time ✌️<br />
