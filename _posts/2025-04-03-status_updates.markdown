Concept is simple: short posts, no titles, kind of like Twitter back in the good 'ol days of 2007. Back then I'd send a SMS message to a number, typing on my QWERTY keyboard phone from Verizon (would need to dig back to see who made it, probably Motorola[^ yep, the <a href="https://www.mobilephonemuseum.com/phone-detail/q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motorola Q</a>. This phone was awesome. So tactile. Going back to something like this could be a fun rabbit hole.]), and the content of that message would publish to my @aaronaiken Twitter profile. No links. No spam. No pictures. No fuss. Just words up to 140 characters. It was great. And great fun!

The first feed of its kind that began to feed the monster.

I've always enjoyed writing and publishing online. There's just something to it that is enjoyable, and the tinkering aspect is there as-well, figuring out how to do things. Trying and failing, the human condition that God has given us to steward. Anyways. I want to build in a '07 Twitter-like feature on my oh so humble static blog. A page of "status updates". It will also have its own RSS feed.

Publishing to it needs to be dead simple. Will experiment with a few different options, but simplicity is key.
