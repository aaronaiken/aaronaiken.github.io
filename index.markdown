# Aaron's Test Website
## Hi there! My name is Aaron Aiken and welcome to my test website
This website is currently intended to test functionality and how to do certain things using Jekyll and Github. I'm enjoying the learning process so far and what is possible to do "on my own" without the need for large and bulky CMS stuff and traditional hosting shenanigans.
