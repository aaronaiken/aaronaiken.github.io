<h2 id="couch">Sleeper couch - $450</h2>
The couch I have is not <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/barsloev-3-seat-sleeper-sofa-with-chaise-tibbleby-beige-gray-50541581/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this exact model</a> but it is extremely similar. Guess IKEA stopped selling the one I have. 

Purchased in 2021, light use.

<h2 id="desk">Desk - FREE</h2>
Large and in charge. Currently in my basement, used previously as my "shipping station". You'll need to take this apart to get it up and out. I can help with that :-) Otherwise, this will be trashed.
